				<h2>CONVErSE</h2>
				<h1>All STars</h1>
				<p>We could tell you that its the OG basketball shoe, created over 100 years ago. Or that the design has largely stayed the same, because why mess with a good thing. Or how it became the unofficial sneaker of all your favorite artists and musicians, who each made it their own. Yeah, we could share a lot of stories, but the one that matters most isnt ours, its yours. It is how and where you take your Chucks. The legacy is long, but what comes next is up to you. We just make the shoe. You make the stories.</p>
